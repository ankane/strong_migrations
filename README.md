# Strong Migrations

Catch unsafe migrations at dev time

:tangerine: Battle-tested at [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/opensource)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ankane/strong_migrations.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ankane/strong_migrations)

## Installation

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'strong_migrations'
```

## How It Works

Strong Migrations detects potentially dangerous operations in migrations, prevents them from running by default, and provides instructions on safer ways to do what you want.

```

ActiveRecord caches attributes which causes problems
when removing columns. Be sure to ignore the column:

class User < ApplicationRecord
  self.ignored_columns = %w(some_column)
end

Once that's deployed, wrap this step in a safety_assured { ... } block.

## Dangerous Operations

The following operations can cause downtime or errors:

- adding a column with a non-null default value to an existing table
- removing a column
- changing the type of a column
- renaming a column
- renaming a table
- adding an index non-concurrently (Postgres only)
- adding a `json` column to an existing table (Postgres only)
- restricting column to have NULL values with setting a default in place

Also checks for best practices:

- keeping non-unique indexes to three columns or less

## The Zero Downtime Way

### Adding a column with a default value

Adding a column with a non-null default causes the entire table to be rewritten.

Instead, add the column without a default value, then change the default.

```ruby
class AddSomeColumnToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def up
    add_column :users, :some_column, :text
    change_column_default :users, :some_column, "default_value"
  end

  def down
    remove_column :users, :some_column
  end
end
```

Don’t backfill existing rows in this migration, as it can cause downtime. See the next section for how to do it safely.

### Backfilling data

To backfill data, use the Rails console or a separate migration with `disable_ddl_transaction!`. Avoid backfilling in a transaction, especially one that alters a table. See [this great article](https://wework.github.io/data/2015/11/05/add-columns-with-default-values-to-large-tables-in-rails-postgres/) on why.

```ruby
class BackfillSomeColumn < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    # Rails 5+
    User.in_batches.update_all some_column: "default_value"

    # Rails < 5
    User.find_in_batches do |users|
      User.where(id: users.ids).update_all some_column: "default_value"
    end
  end
end
```

### Removing a column

ActiveRecord caches database columns at runtime, so if you drop a column, it can cause exceptions until your app reboots. To prevent this:

1. Tell ActiveRecord to ignore the column from its cache

  ```ruby
  # For Rails 5+
  class User < ApplicationRecord
    self.ignored_columns = %w(some_column)
  end

  # For Rails < 5
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    def self.columns
      super.reject { |c| c.name == "some_column" }
    end
  end
  ```

2. Deploy code
3. Write a migration to remove the column (wrap in `safety_assured` block)

  ```ruby
  class RemoveSomeColumnFromUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
    def change
      safety_assured { remove_column :users, :some_column }
    end
  end
  ```

4. Deploy and run migration

### Renaming or changing the type of a column

If you really have to:

1. Create a new column
2. Write to both columns
3. Backfill data from the old column to the new column
4. Move reads from the old column to the new column
5. Stop writing to the old column
6. Drop the old column

One exception is changing a `varchar` column to `text`, which is safe in Postgres 9.1+.

### Renaming a table

If you really have to:

1. Create a new table
2. Write to both tables
3. Backfill data from the old table to new table
4. Move reads from the old table to the new table
5. Stop writing to the old table
6. Drop the old table

### Adding an index (Postgres)

Add indexes concurrently.

```ruby
class AddSomeIndexToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_index :users, :some_index, algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```

If you forget `disable_ddl_transaction!`, the migration will fail. Also, note that indexes on new tables (those created in the same migration) don’t require this.

Check out [this gem](https://github.com/ankane/gindex) to quickly generate index migrations without memorizing the syntax.

### Adding a json column (Postgres)

There’s no equality operator for the `json` column type, which causes issues for `SELECT DISTINCT` queries.

If you’re on Postgres 9.4+, use `jsonb` instead.

If you must use `json`, replace all calls to `uniq` with a custom scope.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  scope :uniq_on_id, -> { select("DISTINCT ON (users.id) users.*") }
end
```

Then add the column:

```ruby
class AddJsonColumnToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    safety_assured { add_column :users, :some_column, :json }
  end
end
```

## Assuring Safety

To mark a step in the migration as safe, despite using method that might otherwise be dangerous, wrap it in a `safety_assured` block.

```ruby
class MySafeMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    safety_assured { remove_column :users, :some_column }
  end
end
```

## Existing Migrations

To mark migrations as safe that were created before installing this gem, create an initializer with:

```ruby
StrongMigrations.start_after = 20170101000000
```

Use the version from your latest migration.

## Dangerous Tasks

For safety, dangerous rake tasks are disabled in production - `db:drop`, `db:reset`, `db:schema:load`, and `db:structure:load`. To get around this, use:

```sh
SAFETY_ASSURED=1 rake db:drop
```

## Faster Migrations

Only dump the schema when adding a new migration. If you use Git, create an initializer with:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.dump_schema_after_migration = Rails.env.development? &&
  `git status db/migrate/ --porcelain`.present?
```

## Schema Sanity

Columns can flip order in `db/schema.rb` when you have multiple developers. One way to prevent this is to [alphabetize them](https://www.pgrs.net/2008/03/13/alphabetize-schema-rb-columns/). Add to the end of your `Rakefile`:

```ruby
task "db:schema:dump": "strong_migrations:alphabetize_columns"
```

## Custom Messages

To customize specific messages, create an initializer with:

```ruby
StrongMigrations.error_messages[:add_column_default] = "Your custom instructions"
```

Check the [source code](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations/blob/master/lib/strong_migrations.rb) for the list of keys.

## Analyze Tables (Postgres)

Analyze tables automatically (to update planner statistics) after an index is added. Create an initializer with:

```ruby
StrongMigrations.auto_analyze = true
```

## Lock Timeout (Postgres)

It’s a good idea to set a lock timeout for the database user that runs migrations. This way, if migrations can’t acquire a lock in a timely manner, other statements won’t be stuck behind it. Here’s a great explanation of [how lock queues work](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2018/02/15/when-postgresql-blocks/).

```sql
ALTER ROLE myuser SET lock_timeout = '10s';
```

There’s also [a gem](https://github.com/gocardless/activerecord-safer_migrations) you can use for this.

## Bigint Primary Keys (Postgres & MySQL)

Rails 5.1+ uses `bigint` for primary keys to keep you from running out of ids. To get this in earlier versions of Rails, check out [this gem](https://github.com/Shopify/rails-bigint-primarykey).
